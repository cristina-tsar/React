      category:"beauty",
      fullDescription:'<div class="article"><h2>Basic Makeup Tip #1: Start With a Face Primer</h2>A primer sets the base for the makeup, giving it a smooth appearance, and even makes it last long. You could either buy a face primer suitable for your skin type, or  use BB creams, CC creams, and tinted moisturisers. These are good cross between makeup primers and moisturisers, and come added with sunscreen too!<h2>Basic Makeup Tip #2. Conceal Dark Circles and Blemishes</h2>In simple makeup routines, a concealer helps cover dark circles and blemishes, while in more complex makeup routines, like HD and airbrush makeup, concealer palettes are used for color corrections, and mask any spots, dark circles, blemishes and large pores. Choose a concealer two shades lighter than your own skin<h2>Basic Makeup Tip #3. Apply Foundation Evenly</h2>A foundation evens out the skin tone without making it look unnaturally bright. To begin, put some foundation on your hand and apply it on your face using a brush. Use a sponge to blend the foundation evenly on your face.<h2>Basic Makeup Tip #4. Sweep a Single-Colour Eyeshadow</h2>For a simple makeup routine, you can sweep a soft eyeshadow colour across the lid. You can try o in dull pink or nude shades. If you are not very comfortable applying eyeshadows, give it a miss, and try coloured eyeliners instead.</div>'

Here’s what we learned from Lively’s cover story in Vogue, which pitches her as the next big “celebrity homemaker.” <h2>1) Blake Lively’s sense of humor is either genius or nonexistent:</h2>“When I say something funny, I don’t laugh,” she says, “so my friends are always like, ‘Hahahahaaaa!’ so people know; they just think I’m a jerk.”<h2>2) You do not want Blake Lively to be your editor:</h2>“With the bow-tie story,” she says, “I think by shifting into the first person, sort of flawed voice that we’ve been trying to accomplish. I was a little liberal with my revisions. <h2>3) Martha Stewart is her Olivia Pope:</h2>And sent her Gladiators to save Blake’s wedding to Ryan Reynolds from total catastrophe: Stewart also acted as a fairy godmother, watching over Blake and Ryan’s wedding.<h2>5) So she calls Ryan Reynolds “darling,” like an old-timey actress would do:</h2>“He’s going to be a great father and leader and patriarch—he’s so meant to be all of those things.</br>6) She eats so much! Seriously, guys! Who even knows how she stays so svelte? “You know that old saying, A way to a man’s heart is through his stomach—that’s me.”</div>'
