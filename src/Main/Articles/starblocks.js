      fullDescription:'<div class="article">I’m kind of sarcastic. Not cynical but sarcastic. I’m a goofy girl. I like to laugh and I like to make other people laugh. Gal Gadot</br> TEDDY WAYNE: You’re in Atlanta now, filming. Can you describe your role in this movie? GAL GADOT: This is the first major comedy role that I’ve done; I had a small role in Date Night [2010]. But it’s going great. I’m playing Natalie Jones, who’s married to Tim Jones [played by Jon Hamm], and they’re spies who work for the agency and are sent to suburbia for a mission. Their cover is blown by another suburban couple, Isla Fisher and Zach Galifianakis. And then everything goes wrong and it’s extremely, extremely funny.</br>WAYNE: So, a bit like The Americans, but comedic? GADOT: Exactly.</br>WAYNE: How are you approaching comedy as opposed to the action and dramatic roles you’ve mostly done in the past?</br>GADOT: I love comedy. In real life I’m the type of girl who doesn’t take herself too seriously. I’m very serious when it comes to work, but I like to make jokes and have a good laugh and make fun of myself. I get to work with amazing people who are so talented and bright—Jon and Isla and Zach.And we have so much fun on set. There’s a very different vibe. This one is more about who’s going to give the best punch line, who’s going to make us laugh first.</br>WAYNE: On to less complicated matters, you own a hotel in Israel with your husband. GADOT: We just sold it.</div>'

      fullDescription:'<div class="article">LEONARDO DICAPRIO: “I AM A LOT CALMER NOW”</br><h2>Mr. DiCaprio, wouldn’t it be nice to do a shitty romantic comedy every once in a while?</h2> I am completely open to doing a romantic comedy, but I will never do something just for the sake of doing a specific genre or because it’s the time or place to do a different type of movie. I think that would be a huge mistake. Ultimately I read a script and I say,</br> “Woah, I am emotionally engaged in this.” I never think about the subject matter, what it will be to popular culture, what it means historically – ultimately all that stuff passes and this movie will come out and it’s either good or it’s not. So that’s the only way I know how to pick films, otherwise I am not connected to it.<h2>How important is it for you to challenge yourself even further with every film that you do?</h2> That really depends on the role. It’s always this grand search in the industry to find good material. Whenever there is good material they all jump on it and it’s like a food fight to get it made. That’s why so many things take years and years to develop because it all shows up on screen. If there are holes in the story structure, if it’s not a compelling, moving narrative, that shows on screen and the movie fails.<h2>You seem to be winning the food fight, considering the material that you get.</h2> It’s been director driven. I have to say that whatever decisions I make, I really do think that movie making is a director’s medium.</div>'

Ending the evening with five trophies for artist of the year,</br> song of the year, best cinematography, best collaboration for “Rain on Me,”</br> and the inaugural Tricon award (given to those who are highly accomplished across three or more disciplines), she opted for an oversized graphic T-shirt and platform boots. Very Gaga.</br>It marked the beginning of a new relationship with Valentino –</br> one that has blossomed into Gaga becoming the face of Voce Viva, its latest perfume dreamed up by the house’s creative director, Pierpaolo Piccioli.</br> “Today, more than ever, senses are the vehicles that will lead us to rebirth. This is the way I personally feel about fragrances: as a sensorial whole experience. </br>Voce Viva to me is a truly immersive event, a sublime evocation that involves the body as well as the mind, liberating instead of covering the skin with a tactile gesture: the perfume,” explains Piccioli.</div>'

Now, as 60 Minutes Lara Logan reports, hes on top of the music world.</br>Bruno Mars is one of the world’s biggest music stars and he’s one of the most driven people we’ve ever seen. Just 31, he’s the product of what he calls a “school of rock” education - a working class life of experiences that have taught him the music business. None of it came easily. He’s been broke, busted and nearly homeless. But this week, following the release of his first album in four years, he’s on top of the music world. </br>Bruno Mars: A lot of people are really quick to say, “That song sounds like this.” Or you-- “He’s tryin’ to sound like this.” And I’m always like, “You’re damn right I am. That’s how-- that’s why we’re all here.” You know, we all grew up idolizing another musician. That’s how this works. That’s how music is created. The “Little Elvis” routine lasted six years. But the lessons of his parents’ Vegas-style Waikiki entertainment revue, have lasted a lifetime.</br>Bruno Mars:  You know, it was, like, “School Of Rock” for me. And it was just this kind of razzle-dazzle lifestyle. Lara Logan:  That’s real showbiz. Bruno Mars: Yeah, show business. You know? Lara Logan: Right? Bruno Mars: And if you wasn’t hitting those notes and the audience wasn’t freaking out, then you weren’t doing it right.</div>'

I think a great fitting little black dress is a closet staple as well as a good everyday bag. For beauty, I’m a fan of a red lip. What is your fashion obsession of the moment? I really love a lot of the collections coming from some several designers from Jason Wu to Givenchy and Balmain. There are some really incredible pieces that I have my eye on! A smell that reminds you of your childhood? The ocean. How would you describe your style as a teenager? I think as a teenager, I was much more beachy. I grew up in Brazil where the weather was warm and a good pair of shorts, a t-shirt and sandals was all you needed. I like to think that my style has evolved since then.</br>Do you have a quick-fix diet? Unfortunately, there is no quick fix. I promise I work out just as hard as everyone else. There is no secret! What do you do to stay in shape? I’ve been boxing for several years. For me, it is both mental and physical maintenance.</br>If you had a superpower, what would it be? Healing powers. In which film would you like to be the leading lady? I would want to play Superwoman or Catwoman in an action film.</br>Is there a particular gift you like to give? Quality time.
